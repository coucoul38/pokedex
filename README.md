# pokedex
**WARNING: Just found out this is no longer connecting to the database, because of a MongoDB update**<br>
A pokedex made in NodeJS, using React. <br>
You can capture and release pokemons, filter pokemons by type, and add new ones.
<br>*Pictures are automatically taken from pokemondb.net, so when adding a pokemon, you need to put the exact name in order for the image to show up*
